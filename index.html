  <p> We study the graph reconstruction problem where one wishes to learn the edge-set of a graph using access to an oracle which returns partial information about a subset (or subsets) of vertices. This line of work began in the late 90's with the edge-detection query model, where the oracle returns whether or not a queried set of vertices contains an edge. There are various ways to strengthen this model. In particular, there have been many works studying additive queries (returns the number of edges in a chosen induced subgraph), cross-additive queries (returns the number of edges between two chosen disjoint sets of vertices), and very recently maximal independent set queries (returns some maximal independent set in a chosen induced subgraph). </p>


  <p> In this work we introduce a new query model, where the oracle returns the <i>number of connected components</i> in a chosen induced subgraph. We prove matching upper and lower bounds for the query complexity of graph reconstruction in this model. Moreover, we show that this model is notably different from previously studied models in terms of the amount of adaptivity needed for efficient algorithms (i.e. round complexity). </p>

  <p> We study the "clustering by crowdsourcing" problem where one wishes to reconstruct a hidden <i>k</i>-partition over <i>n</i> elements with access to a pair-query oracle that answers the question "do these two elements belong to the same set?". The goal is to learn the partition exactly while minimizing the number of queries. It is well known that <i>&Theta;(nk)</i> is necessary and sufficient for adaptive algorithms and <i>&Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>)</i> is necessary and sufficient for non-adaptive algorithms. In terms of adaptivity, previous known algorithms using <i>O(nk)</i> queries used <i>k-1</i> rounds. Minimizing adaptivity is desirable since this allows many queries to be asked in parallel. </p>

  <p><i> What is the fewest rounds of adaptivity that suffice to obtain the optimal <i>O(nk)</i> query complexity? In general, if an algorithm is allowed <i>r</i> rounds of adaptivity, what is the best possible query complexity?  </i></p>

  <p> We obtain an algorithm making <i>O(nk)</i> queries, using only <i>O(loglog n)</i> rounds which is a double-exponential improvement over previous works for reasonably large <i>k</i>. Additionally, for every constant <i>r > 0</i> we characterize the query complexity of algorithms using <i>r</i> rounds, interpolating between the <i>&Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>)</i> non-adaptive and <i>&Theta;(nk)</i> adaptive settings. </p>

  <p> We also study the subset query model where the algorithm can query a subset of at most <i>s</i> elements and the oracle returns the number of sets in the partition intersecting the query. We show that the non-adaptive query complexity of this problem is <i>~&Theta;(n<sup>2</sup> / s<sup>2</sup>)</i>, answering a question left open from our previous NeurIPS '24 paper. For adaptive algorithms we show that the query complexity is <i>~&Theta;(nk / s<sup>2</sup>)</i> and we obtain an interpolation between these two cases in terms of rounds of adaptivity, similar to our result for the pair query model. </p>

  <p> Over the last decade there has been a lot of interest by the learning theory community in "clustering by crowdsourcing" where the goal is to learn a hidden <i>k</i>-partition over <i>n</i> elements with the ability to ask whether two elements belong to the same set or not (pair queries). Our aim in this work is to design <i>non-adaptive</i> algorithms for this task, which are able to ask all of their queries in parallel. However, there is an <i>&Omega;(n<sup>2</sup>)</i> pair query lower bound for non-adaptive algorithms, even when <i>k = 3</i>. </p>

  <p >To go beyond this quadratic barrier, we study a generalized query model where the algorithm can ask for the number of sets in the partition intersecting a queried subset. Chakrabarty-Liao (FSTTCS 24) obtained an <i>O(n)</i> query adaptive algorithm and this query complexity is optimal. We obtain a <i>non-adaptive</i> algorithm which comes very close to the optimal query complexity, up to factors of <i>(log k + loglog n)</i>. We also study the setting where the algorithm is only allowed to query subsets of size at most <i>s</i>, and show upper and lower bounds of <i>~O(n<sup>2</sup> k / s<sup>2</sup>)</i> and <i>&Omega;(n<sup>2</sup> / s<sup>2</sup>)</i>. Finally, we also obtain results for the special case of recovering roughly-balanced partitions and algorithms using two rounds of adaptivity. </p>

  <p> Testing monotonicity of Boolean functions is a classic property testing problem dating back to the origins of the field. Most of the literature has focused on the setting where the tester is allowed to request the value of the function at any point (query-access). If you allow access only to uniform random examples then there is an algorithm using roughly <i>exp(&radic;d))</i> samples which comes from coverting a learning algorithm for monotone functions due to Bshouty-Tamon (J. ACM 1996) into a tester. In this work we obtain a nearly matching lower bound for sample-based testing, showing that this is essentially the best you can do. We also prove nearly optimal lower bounds for functions with larger ranges, and obtain an improved learner/tester for functions over hypergrids and continuous d-dimensional domains. <p/>

  <p> This work studies the problem of testing monotonicity of Boolean-valued functions over the <i>d</i>-dimensional, <i>n</i>-width hypergrid. For the special case of <i>n = 2</i> (the hypercube), a seminal work of Khot-Minzer-Safra (SICOMP 2018) showed that you can test with essentially <i>d<sup>1/2</sup></i> queries and this is optimal among all non-adaptive testers (Chen-Waingarten-Xie STOC 2017). In our paper from STOC 2023 we obtained such a tester that makes <i>n&radic;d</i> queries. </p>

  <p> <i> Can we remove the dependence on n from our STOC 2023 result and obtain a monotonicity tester for Boolean-valued functions over hypergrids that makes <i>&radic;d</i> queries, matching the upper and lower bound for the <i>n = 2</i> case? </i> </p>

  <p> Our main result is a monotonicity tester for such functions that makes <i>d<sup>1/2+o(1)</sup></i> queries, thus resolving the non-adaptive monotonicity testing question for all values of <i>n</i>, up to a <i>d<sup>o(1)</sup></i> factor. Central to our analysis is the inequality obtained in our STOC 2023 paper and our Domain Reduction Theorem from our SODA 2020 paper. We also introduce many new technical ingredients that allow us to replace <i>n</i> by <i>d<sup>o(1)</sup></i> in the query complexity. </p>

  <!-- <p> Monotonicity testing of Boolean functions on the hypergrid, $f:[n]^d \to \{0,1\}$, is a classic topic in property testing. Determining the non-adaptive complexity of this problem is an important open question. For arbitrary $n$, [Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri, SODA 2020] describe a tester with query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4/3}d^{5/6})$. This complexity is independent of $n$, but has a suboptimal dependence on $d$. Recently, [Braverman-Khot-Kindler-Minzer, ITCS 2023] and [Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri, STOC 2023] describe $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} n^3\sqrt{d})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} n\sqrt{d})$-query testers, respectively. These testers have an almost optimal dependence on $d$, but a suboptimal polynomial dependence on $n$. </p>

  <p> In this paper, we describe a non-adaptive, one-sided monotonicity tester with query complexity $O(\varepsilon^{-2} d^{1/2 + o(1)})$, \emph{independent} of $n$. Up to the $d^{o(1)}$-factors, our result resolves the non-adaptive complexity of monotonicity testing for Boolean functions on hypergrids. The independence of $n$ yields a non-adaptive, one-sided $O(\varepsilon^{-2} d^{1/2 + o(1)})$-query monotonicity tester for Boolean functions $f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$ associated with an arbitrary product measure. </p> -->

  <p> This work studies the problem of testing monotonicity of Boolean-valued functions over the <i>d</i>-dimensional, <i>n</i>-width hypergrid. For the special case of <i>n = 2</i> (the hypercube), a seminal work of Khot-Minzer-Safra (SICOMP 2018) showed that you can test with essentially <i>&radic;d</i> queries. To analyze their tester, they proved a directed analogue of Talagrand's isoperimetric inequality for Boolean functions from 1993. Previous works of ours from SODA 2018 and SODA 2020 showed that for general hypergrids (arbitrary <i>n</i>) there is a <i>d<sup>5/6</sup></i> query tester. This result was obtained by proving a directed analogue of an inequality by Margulis for hypergrids. The Margulis inequality is weaker than the Talagrand inequality and so a natural next step in this line of inquiry was to try to generalize Khot-Minzer-Safra's directed Talagrand inequality to hypergrids. </p>

  <p><i> Is there a generalization of the directed Talagrand inequality for hypergrids? Can we test monotonicity of Boolean-valued functions over the <i>d</i>-dimensional, <i>n</i>-width hypergrid with <i>d<sup>1/2</sup></i> queries? </i></p>

  <p> In this paper, we prove a generalization of the directed Talagrand inequality for hypergrids and use it to analyze a tester for Boolean functions on this domain which makes <i>n&radic;d</i> queries. This is the first result to achieve the optimal dependence on <i>d</i> for any <i>n > 2</i>. </p>

  <!-- <p> The problem of testing monotonicity for Boolean functions on the hypergrid, $f:[n]^d \to \{0,1\}$ is a classic topic in property testing. When $n=2$, the domain is the hypercube. For the hypercube case, a breakthrough result of Khot-Minzer-Safra (FOCS 2015) gave a non-adaptive, one-sided tester making $\otilde(\eps^{-2}\sqrt{d})$ queries. Up to polylog $d$ and $\eps$ factors, this bound matches the $\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{d})$-query non-adaptive lower bound (Chen-De-Servedio-Tan (STOC 2015), Chen-Waingarten-Xie (STOC 2017)). For any $n > 2$, the optimal non-adaptive complexity was unknown. A previous result of the authors achieves a $\otilde(d^{5/6})$-query upper bound (SODA 2020), quite far from the $\sqrt{d}$ bound for the hypercube. </p>

  <p> In this paper, we resolve the non-adaptive complexity of monotonicity testing for all constant $n$, up to $\poly(\eps^{-1}\log d)$ factors. Specifically, we give a non-adaptive, one-sided monotonicity tester making $\otilde(\eps^{-2}n\sqrt{d})$ queries. From a technical standpoint, we prove new directed isoperimetric theorems over the hypergrid $[n]^d$. These results generalize the celebrated directed Talagrand inequalities that were only known for the hypercube. </p> -->

  <p> Monotonicity testing of Boolean functions over the hypercube domain has been studied extensively since its introduction by Goldreich-Goldwasser-Lehman-Ron-Samorodnitsky in 1999. A seminal work of Khot-Minzer-Safra (SICOMP 2018) showed that you can test with essentially <i>&radic;d</i> queries. To analyze their tester, they proved a directed analogue of Talagrand's isoperimetric inequality for Boolean functions from 1993. In contrast, the complexity of monotonicity testing of <i>real-valued</i> functions over the hypercube has been established as <i>&Theta;(d)</i> with matching upper and lower bounds (Chakrabarty-Seshadhri 2013, Blais-Brody-Matulef 2012), although the lower bound relies on a family of functions with a large range. </p>

  <p> <i> What is the complexity of testing monotonicity of functions over the hypercube with range size at most <i>r</i>? Do the known directed isoperimetric inequalities extend beyond the Boolean range? </i> </p>

  <p> Our main result is a generalization of Khot-Minzer-Safra's directed Talagrand inequality to <i>real-valued</i> functions whose range consists of any number of elements. To obtain this generalization we prove what we call the Boolean Decomposition Theorem which allows us to "lift" known inequalities for Boolean functions to real-valued functions. Using our generalized directed Talagrand inequality we obtain an optimal tester for functions with range size <i>r</i>. Prior to our work it wasn't known whether such testers exist even for <i>r = 3</i>. </p>

  <!-- <p> Using our generalized directed Talagrand inequality we establish the following two results. (a) We give a non-adaptive, 1-sided error monotonicity tester for functions over the hypercube with range size at most r that makes r sqrt(d) queries and show a matching lower bound for this class of testers. (b) We give an algorithm for approximating the distance to monotonicity of real-valued functions that matches the state of the art for Boolean functions. </p> -->


  <!-- <p> We generalize the celebrated isoperimetric inequality of Khot, Minzer, and Safra (SICOMP 2018) for Boolean functions to the case of real-valued functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^d\to\mathbb{R}$. Our main tool in the proof of the generalized inequality is a new Boolean decomposition that represents every real-valued function $f$ over an arbitrary partially ordered domain as a collection of Boolean functions over the same domain, roughly capturing the distance of $f$ to monotonicity and the structure of violations of $f$ to monotonicity. </p>

  <p> We apply our generalized isoperimetric inequality to improve algorithms for testing monotonicity and approximating the distance to monotonicity for real-valued functions. Our tester for monotonicity has query complexity $\widetilde{O}(\min(r \sqrt{d},d))$, where $r$ is the size of the image of the input function. (The best previously known tester, by Chakrabarty and Seshadhri (STOC 2013), makes $O(d)$ queries.) Our tester is nonadaptive and has 1-sided error. We show a matching lower bound for nonadaptive, 1-sided error testers for monotonicity. We also show that the distance to monotonicity of real-valued functions that are $\alpha$-far from monotone can be approximated nonadaptively within a factor of $O(\sqrt{d\log d})$ with query complexity polynomial in  $1/\alpha$ and the dimension $d$. This query complexity is known to be nearly optimal for nonadaptive algorithms even for the special case of Boolean functions. (The best previously known distance approximation algorithm for real-valued functions, by Fattal and Ron (TALG 2010) achieves $O(d\log r)$-approximation.) </p> -->

  <p> In this paper we showed that <i>n</i> can be replaced by <i>poly(d)</i> in a black-box fashion, thus implying a <i>o(d)</i> tester with no dependence on <i>n</i> by combining with our previous paper. The theorem that achieves this reduction is our main contribution, which we call the Domain Reduction Theorem. Going beyond the hypergrid, we also prove a version of this theorem over <i>d</i>-dimensional continuous spaces and attain a <i>o(d)</i> query tester for this domain. </p>  

  <!--  which says the following. Suppose f is a Boolean-valued function over the d-dimensional, n-width hypergrid. Now sub-sample k values from [n] iid in each dimension and consider the restriction of f to the resulting d-dimensional, k-width sub-hypergrid. We prove that if k > poly(d/epsilon), then the distance to monotonicity is preserved by the restriction, up to a constant factor. Therefore, it suffices to test for monotonicity of the restriction, replacing any dependence on n by a dependence on k. Using standard measure-theoretic tools we are also able to extend the Domain Reduction Theorem and testing result to apply to measurable Boolean-valued functions over d-dimensional continuous space under product distributions. -->

  <!-- <p> We describe a $\tilde{O}(d^{5/6})$-query monotonicity tester for Boolean functions $f:[n]^d \to \{0,1\}$ on the $n$-hypergrid. This is the first $o(d)$ monotonicity tester with query complexity independent of $n$. Motivated by this independence of $n$, we initiate the study of monotonicity testing of measurable Boolean functions $f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$ over the continuous domain, where the distance is measured with respect to a product distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$. We give a $\tilde{O}(d^{5/6})$-query monotonicity tester for such functions. </p>

  <p> Our main technical result is a domain reduction theorem for monotonicity. For any function $f:[n]^d \to \{0,1\}$, let $\epsilon_f$ be its distance to monotonicity. Consider the restriction $\hat{f}$ of the function on a random $[k]^d$ sub-hypergrid of the original domain. We show that for $k = \text{poly}(d/\epsilon)$, the expected distance of the restriction is $\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{\hat{f}}] = \Omega(\epsilon_f)$. Previously, such a result was only known for $d=1$ (Berman-Raskhodnikova-Yaroslavtsev, STOC 2014). Our result for testing Boolean functions over $[n]^d$ then follows by applying the $d^{5/6}\cdot \text{poly}(1/\epsilon,\log n, \log d)$-query hypergrid tester of Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri (SODA 2018). </p>

  <p> To obtain the result for testing Boolean functions over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we use standard measure theoretic tools to reduce monotonicity testing of a measurable function $f$ to monotonicity testing of a discretized version of $f$ over a hypergrid domain $[N]^d$ for large, but finite, $N$ (that may depend on $f$). The independence of $N$ in the hypergrid tester is crucial to getting the final tester over $\mathbb{R}^d$. </p> -->

  <p> This work studies the problem of monotonicity testing of Boolean-valued functions over the <i>d</i>-dimensional, <i>n</i>-width hypergrid. Prior to this paper the best known testers had query complexity linear in <i>d</i>, and independent of <i>n</i>. For the special case of <i>n = 2</i>, it was known that <i>o(d)</i>-query testers are possible by exploiting a connection to isoperimetric inequalities for Boolean functions. </p>

  </p><i>To what extent does this connection extend to hypergrids and can we achieve <i>o(d)</i> query testers? </i></p>

  <p>In this paper we gave the first tester for the setting of arbitrary <i>n > 2</i> with query complexity sublinear in <i>d</i>, although with a poly-logarithmic depedendence on <i>n</i>. The main technical contribution is a directed Margulis-style isoperimetric inequality for hypergrids, generalizing a result from the hypercube setting by Chakrabarty-Seshadhri (STOC 2013).
  </p>  
  <!-- <p> We study monotonicity testing of Boolean functions over the hypergrid [n]^d and design a non-adaptive tester with 1-sided error whose query complexity is O(d^{5/6}) \poly(\log n,1/\eps). Previous to our work, the best known testers had query complexity linear in d but independent of n. We improve upon these testers as long as n = 2^{d^{o(1)}}. </p>

  <p> To obtain our results, we work with what we call "the augmented hypergrid", which adds extra edges to the hypergrid. Our main technical contribution is a Margulis-style isoperimetric result for the augmented hypergrid, and our tester, like previous testers for the hypercube domain, performs directed random walks on this structure. </p> -->
